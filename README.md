# EDA_on_Earthquake_Dataset
I have made this project for learning purpose. In this project, I have done the Exploratory Data Analysis on dataset of earthquakes. I have added comments in this notebook about everything I learn, so, it may look like silly. 
## Tools Used

- [Opendatasets](https://pypi.org/project/opendatasets/) => Used this library for downloading dataset
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn => Used these libraries for EDA
